# Extracted Business Logic Summary

This document summarizes the business logic that has been extracted from UI components into pure Python modules with comprehensive unit tests.

## Overview

**Goal**: Extract complex business logic from UI components to improve testability, reusability, and maintainability while following separation of concerns principles.

**Results**: 3 new pure Python modules with 82 comprehensive unit tests covering Dragon Dice game rules and logic.

## Extracted Modules

### 1. Army Validation (`game_logic/army_validation.py`)

**Extracted From**: `views/player_setup_view.py` (lines 307-381)

**Purpose**: Validates army compositions according to official Dragon Dice rules.

**Key Classes**:
- `DragonDiceArmyValidator`: Main validation engine
- `ArmyComposition`: Represents an army for validation
- `ArmyCompositionBuilder`: Helper for creating compositions from various sources
- `ValidationResult`: Structured validation results

**Official Rules Implemented**:
1. Each army must have at least 1 unit
2. No army can exceed 50% of total force points (rounded down)
3. Magic units cannot exceed 50% of total force points (rounded down)
4. Total army points must equal selected force size

**Features**:
- Supports single army and full composition validation
- Handles single/multiplayer differences (horde army rules)
- Provides detailed error reporting with bulleted lists
- Calculates force size limits and magic unit constraints
- Human-readable validation summaries

**Test Coverage**: 22 unit tests covering all validation rules and edge cases

### 2. Die Face Analysis (`game_logic/die_face_analyzer.py`)

**Extracted From**: `components/army_die_face_summary_widget.py` (lines 80-138)

**Purpose**: Analyzes die face distributions from unit collections for tactical assessment.

**Key Classes**:
- `DieFaceAnalyzer`: Main analysis engine
- `DieFaceCount`: Represents counted die faces with icons
- `UnitDieFaceExtractor`: Utility for extracting die face data

**Analysis Features**:
- Counts die faces across unit collections (excluding ID faces)
- Prioritizes face types by tactical importance (melee, missile, magic, save, etc.)
- Provides tactical analysis (offensive/defensive/utility strengths)
- Compares army compositions for strategic planning
- Formats results in compact (⚔️3 🏹2) or detailed formats

**Advanced Analysis**:
- Face distribution percentages
- Most/least common face types
- Army composition comparisons
- Tactical strength assessment (balanced vs specialized)
- Weakness identification

**Test Coverage**: 23 unit tests covering counting, sorting, analysis, and formatting

### 3. Unit Management (`game_logic/unit_manager.py`)

**Extracted From**: `views/unit_selection_dialog.py` (lines 102-219)

**Purpose**: Manages sorting, organizing, and instance creation for Dragon Dice units.

**Key Classes**:
- `UnitSorter`: Flexible multi-criteria sorting system
- `UnitOrganizer`: Groups units by species, class, cost ranges
- `UnitInstanceManager`: Handles unit instance creation and tracking
- `UnitCollectionManager`: High-level unified interface
- `SortCriteria` & `UnitInstanceConfig`: Configuration objects

**Sorting Capabilities**:
- Predefined configurations: display_default, alphabetical, by_cost, by_class, by_power_desc
- Custom multi-key sorting with reversible ordering
- Support for both object and dictionary-style units

**Organization Features**:
- Group by species (extracted from unit type IDs)
- Group by class type (Heavy Melee, Missile, Magic, etc.)
- Group by cost ranges with customizable brackets
- Advanced filtering with string, numeric, list, and function filters

**Instance Management**:
- Unique instance ID generation with configurable patterns
- Instance counting per army/unit type
- Bulk instance creation
- Reset capabilities for army reorganization

**Collection Operations**:
- Search across multiple fields
- Generate collection statistics (totals, averages, distributions)
- Organize for display with automatic sorting

**Test Coverage**: 37 unit tests covering sorting, organizing, filtering, and instance management

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Improved Testability**
- **82 comprehensive unit tests** vs. 0 tests for embedded logic
- Independent testing without UI framework dependencies
- Fast test execution (0.11s for all 82 tests)
- Clear test isolation and focused assertions

### 2. **Enhanced Reusability** 
- Logic can be shared across multiple UI components
- Backend services can use the same validation rules
- API endpoints can leverage the same business logic
- Command-line tools can reuse the same algorithms

### 3. **Better Maintainability**
- Business rules centralized in dedicated modules
- Game rule changes only require updates in one location
- UI components focus purely on presentation
- Clear separation between business logic and view logic

### 4. **Increased Reliability**
- Official Dragon Dice rules properly encoded and tested
- Edge cases covered with specific test scenarios
- Validation logic matches original UI implementation
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Integration Points

### Current UI Integration
The extracted modules are designed to be drop-in replacements for the embedded logic:

```python
# Before: Embedded in UI
def _validate_inputs(self) -> bool:
    validation_errors = []
    # 70+ lines of validation logic mixed with UI code

# After: Clean separation
def _validate_inputs(self) -> bool:
    armies = ArmyCompositionBuilder.from_army_widgets(self.army_setup_widgets)
    result = self.validator.validate_army_composition(armies, self.force_size, self.num_players)
    if not result.is_valid:
        self._set_status_message("• " + "\n• ".join(result.errors), "red")
        return False
    return True
```

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **API Integration**: Validate army compositions in web services
2. **AI Integration**: Use tactical analysis for computer opponents  
3. **Import/Export**: Validate army lists from external sources
4. **Tournament Tools**: Batch validation of multiple army lists
5. **Balance Analysis**: Statistical analysis of die face distributions across unit types

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Positive Cases**: Valid configurations that should pass
- **Negative Cases**: Invalid configurations with specific error conditions
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, missing data
- **Integration Cases**: Multiple components working together

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual method and class testing
- **Validation Tests**: Rule enforcement and error reporting  
- **Performance Tests**: Large data set handling
- **Compatibility Tests**: Multiple input format support
