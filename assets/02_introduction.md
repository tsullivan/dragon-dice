# Object of the Game

In the game of Dragon Dice®, you use dice to represent armies of different fantasy species and monsters which battle to control essential pieces of terrain. Any number of players can share in this struggle. The first player to capture two terrains immediately wins the game. A player also wins if they have the last surviving unit(s) in play.

# Get to Know Your Dice

The dice are the building blocks of the Dragon Dice® game. Units, items, dragons, and terrains are all represented by dice of various shapes and colors. You can tell what a die is by how many sides it has, and what colors it contains. Here is a summary of the various dice of Dragon Dice®:

**Four-sided**  
These dice represent equipment and medallions. Equipment comes in three sizes: Small, Medium, Large die. Each equipment produces only one type of result. Medallions are items of immense power and the largest of the four-siders.

**Six-sided**  
These dice represent the soldiers in your army. They come in four sizes and can produce many different types of results. All six-sided dice belong to a species, except for relics (see Items in the 'Advanced Rules' section, @59_items.md).

**Eight-sided**  
These represent objectives that each player’s armies are attempting to capture. They come in two sizes. The larger dice are called terrains. The smaller dice are called minor terrains and are discussed in @15_terrains.md.

**Ten-sided**  
The ten-sided dice represent either monsters or artifacts. Monsters are always part of a species and artifacts are a type of item.

**Twelve-sided**  
The twelve-sided dice represent dragons. They come in two forms: drakes, which have wings, and wyrms, which have a treasure chest.
