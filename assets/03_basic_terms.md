# Basic Terms

There are a few things you should know before you start your first game. Once you’ve got these concepts mastered, they will help you understand the rules as you play through your games. The following terms are used throughout this rulebook:

**Species**  
The fantastical entities represented by units in the game. Coral Elves, Goblins, and Scalders are examples of species. Eldarim of all elements are a single species. Dragonkin of all elements are also a single species.

**Unit**  
Any six-sided or ten-sided die of a species is a unit. The six-sided units come in four sizes: Small (16mm), Medium (18mm), Large (20mm), and Champion (22mm). A ten-sided unit is called a monster.

**Item**  
Equipment (non-metallic four-sided dice), medallions (metallic four-sided dice), artifacts (the tensided dice not of a species) and relics (metallic six-sided dice) are collectively known as items.

**Health**  
Units and dragons have a specific amount of health which determines how much damage it takes to kill them. Small units have one health (one point of damage kills a small unit). Medium units have two health. Large units have three health. Champions and monsters have four health. Dragons have five health. White Dragons have ten health.

**Force**  
A player’s force is all of his or her armies, items and units combined. At the start of a game players agree to a point value for their total force size and use that to select their forces. Any dice in your summoning pool are not part of your total force size.

**Point Value (Army Construction)**  
Units and items both have point values based on their die size, as follows:
| Die | Points
|-|-
| Six-sided & ten-sided units | Equal to their health
| Small Equipment | One
| Medium Equipment | Three for each pair (two points for the first and one point for the second - while the Medium dice do not need to be brought as a pair, the first is always two points)
| Large Equipment | Two
| Artifact | Three
| Medallion | Four
| Relic | Four

**Icons:**  
The symbols on the faces of each die are called icons. There are two types of icons on units and items: Action and ID.

**Action icons**  
There are two types of action icons: normal action icons and Special Action Icons (hereafter called SAIs). These tell what actions a unit or item can perform in the game. For example, if a unit has an icon of a bow on one face, it generates one missile result when that face is rolled.

**ID icons**  
These serve to identify the units. For example, an icon of a Dwarf wearing a feathered cap on a small die identifies it as a “Crossbowman”. An ID icon always generates whatever results you are rolling for. If you are rolling for saves, ID icons generate save results; if you are rolling for maneuvers, they generate maneuver results; and so forth. Furthermore, each unit’s ID icon generates a number of results equal to its health. Artifacts also have an ID icon, which generates four results.

**Terrain**  
The faces on each terrain die are numbered from 1 to 8, and also feature an icon. The numbers represent the distance between armies whereas the icons represent which action may be used to engage an opposing army at that distance. A low number showing on a face means the armies are very far apart, while a large number means the armies are very close.

**Capture (Terrain)**  
When an army maneuvers a terrain to its eighth face it captures that terrain. If you capture two terrains, you win the game. A terrain is only considered captured when it is on its eighth face.

**Elements and Color:**  
The colors of the units represent the magical elements that make up each species. The colors of the items, terrains, and dragons represent the magical elements that make up each item, terrain, or dragon.

**The Elements**
The five elements are represented as follows:
| Element | Color
|-|-
| Death | Black
| Air | Blue
| Water | Green
| Fire | Red
| Earth | Yellow

These two colors are used in addition to the elements:
| Color | Represents
|-|-
| Ivory | The lack of any elements
| White | The presence of all elements

In addition to the magical elements which make up all of Esfah, the world of Dragon Dice®, there is a powerful and mysterious metal called Eldrymetallum (also known as "star metal"), which is not native to Esfah. This rare metal is primarily found in meteors. Relics are made of a pure form of this metal. It has also been alloyed with native metals and alloys such as bronze, silver, and gold. Items or units made with star metal or its alloys are called metallic, alloys, or non-elemental.

**Elements and Colors of the terrains**  
The following table shows the different terrain types and which elements each of those terrains contain:
| Terrain Type | Elements (Colors)
|-|-
| Coastland | Air & Water (blue & green)

| Highland | Fire & Earth (red & yellow)
| Swampland | Water & Earth (green & yellow)

**Army**  
All of your units and items at a single terrain or the Reserve Area form an army:
- _Home Army:_ This army is at your Home Terrain.
- _Horde Army:_ This army is at another player’s Home Terrain.
- _Campaign Army:_ This army is at the Frontier Terrain
- _Reserve Army:_ This army is in your Reserve Area.

**Reserve Area**  
At times, units need to pull back and regroup, or move to another terrain. They must first retreat to your Reserve Area. The units in your Reserve Area form your Reserve Army.

**Dead / Dead Unit Area (DUA)**  
Units that take damage equal to or exceeding their health are dead. They are removed from their army and placed in your Dead Unit Area (or DUA).

**Buried / Buried Unit Area (BUA)**  
Dead units may be buried. Buried units are removed from the Dead Unit Area and placed in your Buried Unit Area (or BUA).

**Promotion/Promote**  
Some effects allow you to promote your units to other units which have more health. Promotion is detailed in @30_rules_reference_promotion.md.

**Recruitment/Recruit**  
Some effects allow you to recruit a unit to an army. To recruit a unit, simply move a small (onehealth) unit from your DUA to the recruiting army.

**Summoning Pool**  
This is where dragons, Dragonkin, and minor terrains are put at the start of the game. The Summoning Pool is kept separate from the DUA and BUA.
