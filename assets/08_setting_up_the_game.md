# Setting Up The Game

## Step 1: Decide The Total Force Size

Players determine the size of their forces by choosing a total point value. They bring units and/or items totaling that point value to the game. Suggested total force sizes are 15, 24, 30, 36 or 60 points. Players are free to use only one species, or mix multiple species in the same force. Regardless of the total force size, each player must bring two terrains - one Home Terrain and one proposed Frontier Terrain:

- **Home Terrain:** The terrain die placed in front of you at the start of the game. You select this die. Each Home Terrain is adjacent to the Frontier Terrain, but not adjacent to any other Home Terrain.
- **Frontier Terrain:** The terrain die placed in the center of the table at the start of the game. Each player proposes a terrain die to be the Frontier Terrain. The Frontier Terrain for the game is selected from these proposed terrains. The Frontier Terrain is adjacent to every Home Terrain.

Each player is also required to bring exactly one dragon for each 24 points of total force size, or part
thereof. The dragons can be any types. Your dragons are placed in your Summoning Pool.

## Step 2: Assemble Forces

Players divide their units and items into three armies:
1. **Home Army:** The army that will be placed at a player’s own Home Terrain
2. **Horde Army:** The army that will be placed at an opponent’s Home Terrain. This army is used to determine the order of play at the beginning of the game
3. **Campaign Army:** The army that will be placed at a terrain where you do not have an army (Frontier Terrain in a two-player game).

When assembling armies, players may have no more than half of the points (rounded down) of their total forces placed in a single army. There must be at least one unit in each army. After initial army placement, this army size restriction is no longer in effect. Armies should be assembled in secret and are revealed in step 4 below. Players may find it useful to assemble their armies behind a screen.

## Step 3: Set the Battlefield
Players choose one of the terrain dice they brought to be their Home Terrain and place it in front of them to the left, placing the other terrain die in the center of the playing area as their proposed Frontier Terrain.

## Step 4: Determine Order of Play

All players reveal their forces at the same time. All players then make a maneuver roll with their Horde Armies: roll the army and count maneuver results. Only count SAIs that generate maneuver results, ignore any special results. Since this army is not at a terrain, any affect a terrain would have is ignored. In the event of a tie, players re-roll until there is a winner.

The player who rolls the most maneuver results may choose to either take the first turn or select which proposed Frontier Terrain will be used during the game. If the player chooses to play first, then their opponent selects the Frontier Terrain. If the player who rolled the most maneuver results decides to select the Frontier Terrain, then their opponent takes the first turn.

Any one of the proposed Frontier Terrain dice may be selected. All other proposed Frontier Terrains are removed from the game and not used.

Place your armies as follows:
1. Their Home Army is placed at their Home Terrain.
2. Their Horde Amy is placed at any other player’s Home Terrain.
3. Their Campaign Army is placed at any terrain where the player has not already placed an army.

## Step 5: Determine Starting Distance

Each player rolls their Home Terrain die to determine the initial battle distances. The player that selected the Frontier Terrain rolls that die. If you roll an eight, roll again. If you roll a seven, turn the die down to six. All terrains will therefore start the game showing a number between one and six.
