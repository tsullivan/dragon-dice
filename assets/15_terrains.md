# Terrains

## Eighth Face

If you maneuver a terrain to its eighth face (the number 8 is showing), then your marching army captures that terrain. When you capture a terrain, orient the terrain die so the icon faces your army. The army that has captured a terrain receives several advantages for as long as it retains control of that terrain die:

 - When rolling the army, all ID results are doubled, for any roll.
 - The army may take a melee, missile, or magic action, but opposing armies at the terrain are restricted to a melee action.
 - The army may make use of the Eighth Face Icon as shown in the table below.

Eighth face advantages are cumulative with any species abilities.

A terrain at its eighth face turns back to its seventh face (the number 7 is showing) whenever the controlling army abandons the terrain, is out-maneuvered by an opposing army, or all its units are killed or removed. When the terrain is moved from the eighth face, all advantages gained by your controlling army cease.

### Eighth Face Icons

The Eighth Face Icons are used as follows:

| Terrain | Eighth Face Effect
|-|-
| City | During the Eighth Face Phase you may recruit a small (1 health) unit to, or promote one unit in, the controlling army.
| Standing Stones | All units in your controlling army may convert any or all of their magic results to an element this terrain contains.
| Temple | Your controlling army and all units in it cannot be affected by any opponent’s death magic. During the Eighth Face Phase you may force another player to bury one unit of their choice in their DUA.
| Tower | Your controlling army may use a missile action to attack any opponent’s army. If attacking a Reserve Army, only count non-ID missile results.

## Advanced Terrains

Advanced terrains are special terrains that offer new objectives for armies to capture. Advanced terrains follow all the usual rules for terrains, with one exception: _an advanced terrain may only be placed at the frontier._

Like other terrains, each advanced terrain has a unique Eighth Face effect. These are described below:

| Terrain | Eighth Face Effect
|-|-
| Castle | When you capture this terrain, choose one of the following four terrain types: City, Standing Stones, Temple, or Tower. The Castle becomes that terrain until its face is moved.
| Dragon’s Lair | During the Eighth Face Phase, you may summon a dragon that matches at least one element of this terrain, an Ivory Dragon or any Ivory Hybrid Dragon, and place it at any terrain. The Dragon's Lair may not summon a White Dragon.
| Grove | During the Eighth Face Phase move one non‑Dragonkin unit from any player’s BUA to their DUA, a Dragonkin unit or minor terrain from your BUA to your Summoning Pool, or an Item from your BUA to your army controlling this eighth face. This is not optional and must be performed if possible.
| Vortex | During any non-maneuver army roll at this terrain, before resolving SAIs (see step 3 of ‘Die Roll Resolution’), you may re-roll one unit, ignoring the previous result.

## Minor Terrains

The smaller (18mm) eight-sided dice are minor terrain dice. These dice represent lesser objectives for an army to capture at a particular terrain while trying to secure the terrain itself. These dice do not count toward victory, but they can help achieve it.

A player may bring a total of minor terrain dice to a game equal to the number of terrains in the game plus one (for example in a 2-player game, you may bring up to four minor terrains). Minor terrains are placed in a player’s Summoning Pool at the start of the game.

### Bringing a Minor Terrain into Play

When an army marches, the army’s owner may bring a minor terrain into play from their Summoning Pool instead of taking a maneuver step. The minor terrain’s elements must match at least one element of the terrain where the army is located. Deadlands may be brought into play at any terrain, regardless of that terrain’s elements.

Roll the minor terrain when it enters play and immediately apply its result - alternate action, modify results, or disaster (See Minor Terrain Icons below). The rolled result will remain in effect as the active bonus for the army who owns the minor terrain until it is rolled again (see below). Place the die beside the army to show the bonus.

On all future turns, when an army that controls a minor terrain marches, as they start that march, they must either:
- Forfeit the maneuver step in order to keep the result showing on the minor terrain, OR,
- Roll the minor terrain before the maneuver step and apply its new result. The rolled result will remain in effect as the active bonus for the army who owns the minor terrain until the minor terrain is rolled again on a future turn.

### Rules that apply to Minor Terrains

- Each army may only have one minor terrain in play.
- An army that has captured an Eighth Face may not bring a minor terrain into play. If an army controlling a minor terrain captures the terrain’s Eighth Face, then the minor terrain is buried.
- If an army controlling a minor terrain leaves the terrain (all the units in the army are moved or killed), then the minor terrain is buried.
- When an army controlling a minor terrain takes a march, they may choose to bury it instead of taking the maneuver step. A new minor terrain may not be brought into play by that army this turn.
- A minor terrain’s elements are available to the _controlling army_ as if they were part of the terrain for the purposes of Species Abilities. It does not add to the number or type of elemental dragon breath attacks that a White Dragon inflicts.
- Any rules that refer to or target a _terrain_ do not apply to minor terrains.

### Deadlands

In addition to other minor terrain rules, each Deadlands (death) minor terrain a player controls counts as ⚰️ units (of any species) in their DUA for use with species abilities (see @21_species_abilities.md). In a 24 point game, a Deadlands counts as one unit, in a 25-48 point game it counts as two, and so on. Deadlands may be brought into play at any terrain.

### Minor Terrain Die Faces
