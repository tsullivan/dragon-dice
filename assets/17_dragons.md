# Dragons

Dragons can be summoned using magic to wage war against armies on the battlefield. They are
tough adversaries and even the most battle-hardened army has been known to fall to a dragon.

## TYPES OF DRAGONS

There are many different types of dragon that may be brought to a game of Dragon Dice®, each with a different combination of elements. Each type of dragon also has unique characteristics and interacts with other dragons and armies in different ways. Each dragon has 5 health and 5 automatic saves. A White Dragon has 10 health and 5 automatic saves.

**Elemental Dragon**  
The standard dragon is an Elemental Dragon. It is made up of one of the five elements.

**Hybrid Dragons**  
Hybrid Dragons are composed of two elements. When a breath result is rolled, apply both elemental breath effects. Hybrid Dragons are affected by any spell or effect that can affect either of its elements.

**Ivory Dragons**  
Ivory Dragons may be summoned by using any one single element of magic or by any effect of a single element (such as a Dragon's Lair or Dragon Staff). Ivory Dragons may only be summoned from the Summoning Pool. They may not be summoned from another terrain.

**Ivory Hybrid Dragons**  
Ivory Hybrid Dragons are composed of one element and ivory. When a breath result is rolled, apply the elemental breath effect. Ivory Hybrid Dragons are affected by any spell or effect that can affect its element or ivory. Ivory Hybrid Dragons can only be summoned from a terrain by magic or an effect that matches their element.

**White Dragons**  
White Dragons have ten health instead of five. All damage inflicted from a White Dragon’s claws, jaws, tail and wing results are doubled. In addition, treasure results are also doubled, allowing two units to be promoted instead of one. White Dragons count as two normal dragons when assembling forces. White Dragons can only be summoned by the Summon White Dragon spell.

## Dragon Attacks

During the Dragon Attack Phase, at every terrain where there is an army belonging to the marching player, every dragon present will attack, regardless of who owns or summoned the dragon. Dragon attacks only occur at terrains that contain an army belonging to the marching player.

Where possible, a dragon will always target another dragon instead of the marching player’s army. Dragons determine which other dragons they will attack based on their element. If a dragon cannot attack another dragon present at the terrain, or if no other dragons are present, then the dragon will always attack the marching player’s army. The table below describes which target a dragon will attack.

| Attacking Dragon's Element | Elemental | Hybrid | Ivory | Ivory Hybrid | White | Army
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
| Elemental | Will attack unless same element | Will attack | Will not attack | Will attack unless the element matches | Will attack | Will attack if no valid dragon target
| Hybrid | Will attack | Will attack unless matching both elements | Will not attack | Will attack unless matching one element | Will attack | will attack if no valid dragon target
| Ivory | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will attack
| Ivory Hybrid | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will not attack | Will attack
| White | Will attack | Will attack | Will not attack | Will attack | Will not attack | Will attack if no valid dragon target

It is important to note that some dragons may attack a type of dragon that will not attack them. As such, dragons do not always ‘fight back’. For example, an Elemental Dragon could attack an Ivory Hybrid Dragon, while that Ivory Hybrid Dragon attacks the army.

Dragons attacking the marching player’s army will all attack at the same time. The owner of an attacking dragon rolls that dragon’s die. If the marching player has armies located at multiple terrains, each containing one or more dragons, that player decides the order in which each of the dragon attacks take place.

### Performing the Dragon Attack

To perform a dragon attack, players should follow these steps:

**1. Determine target of dragon attacks**
Consult the table above to determine whether dragons will attack the army or another dragon.

**2. Designate dragon vs dragon targets**
The owner of each dragon attacking another dragon designates in secret which dragon their dragon will attack. Once each player has designated their dragon’s target, players reveal their choices. If there are no dragon vs dragon attacks, skip this step.

**3. Roll dragons**
The owners of the attacking dragons roll them, taking note of the results (damage is not applied until step 7, with the exception of breath results when a dragon is attacking an army).

**4. Resolve all breath results**
Against an army, breath results are resolved immediately. Each dragon breath is resolved one at a time, by killing the required health-worth of units. After units have been killed, apply all elemental breath effects to the targeted army or units.

**5. Resolve all treasures**
Skip this step if no army is being attacked. If a dragon rolled a treasure icon while attacking an army, that army may promote any one unit.

**6. Roll the army’s response to the dragon attack**
Skip this step if no army is being attacked. The army makes a combination roll, counting any melee, missile, or save results generated by normal icons and SAIs. Any SAI that generates melee, missile, or save results or states it has an effect during a dragon attack is applied.

The damage to slay a dragon must come from either melee or missile results - they may not be combined, though when fighting multiple dragons, you may allocate melee results to one and missile results to another, etc. Multiple dragons may be killed in one attack as long there are enough missile and/or melee results to kill them. Any units or artifacts that roll their IDs may each allocate them as save, missile, or melee results and may split those results between types (for example a 3 health unit rolls an ID. The results may be considered 3 melee, 3 missile, 3 saves or any combination of them).

**7. Resolve damage**
Dragons and armies inflict damage simultaneously, so even if a unit is killed, its results may still be applied to the army attack (only breath results are resolved before this step). When a dragon is killed it is returned to the Summoning Pool.

**8. Promotion**
If an army kills one or more dragons, it may promote as many units as possible (see Promotion in @30_rules_reference_promotion.md).

**9. Resolve wings**
Any surviving dragons that rolled wings are returned to their Summoning Pool. After all dragon attacks are resolved, play continues on to the next phase.

### Dragon Breath

Against another dragon, a dragon breath inflicts five (ten for a White Dragon) points of damage; roll the dragon again and apply the new result as well. If breath is rolled in an attack against an army:

- Five health-worth of units in the army are killed.
- The elemental breath effect from the table below is applied, according to the elements of the dragon.

The owner of the army being attacked chooses which units are killed. Halving modifiers from elemental breath effects are not cumulative, though multiple different elemental breath effects may apply at the same time (for example: an army affected by death and water breath would ignore ID results and halve its missile results).

| Element | Type | Effect
|-|-|-
| Air | Lightning Bolt | The army’s melee results are halved until the beginning of its next turn. Results are rounded down
| Death | Dragon Plague | The army ignores all of its ID results until the beginning of its next turn
| Earth | Petrify | The army’s maneuver results are halved until the beginning of its next turn. Results are rounded down
| Fire | Dragon Fire | Roll the units killed by this dragon’s breath attack. Those that do not generate a save result are buried
| Ivory | Life Drain | No additional effect
| Water | Poisonous Cloud | The army’s missile results are halved until the beginning of its next turn. Results are rounded down
| White | Terrain Empathy | An additional five health-worth of units in the army are killed, bringing the total health killed to ten. The army suffers the elemental breath effects of both elements of the terrain.

### Dragon Icons

This section shows each of the symbols on the dragon’s die and explains their effects.

| Result | Effect
|-|-
| Belly (dragon) | The dragon’s automatic saves do not count during this attack.
| Dragon Breath | See the section on ‘Dragon Breath’ above.
| Claws | A dragon’s claws inflict six points of damage.
| Jaws | A dragon’s jaws inflict twelve points of damage.
| Tail (dragon) | The dragon’s tail inflicts three points of damage; roll the dragon again and apply the new result as well.
| Treasure | If the dragon is attacking an army, one unit in that army may be promoted (see Promotion in @30_rules_reference_promotion.md).
| Wing | A dragon’s wings inflict five points of damage. After the attack, if the dragon is still alive, it flies away. Return the dragon to its owner’s Summoning Pool.
