## Die Roll Resolution

Players do not roll dice simultaneously unless a specific rule says so. During a march, the marching player always rolls their army first, followed by any opposing players. Once the marching player has finished resolving their roll, the opposing players resolve their rolls in turn order. Each player follows this process one by one:

|Step|Description|
|-|-|
| 1 | Roll the dice. |
| 2 | When rolling for saves against an attack, SAI effects delayed from the attacker roll are applied now. |
| 3 | Check to see if any existing effects will force or allow a die to be re‑rolled. This includes SAIs that have a re‑rolling effect (for example, Bullseye). Apply these effects one at a time until all re-rolls have been made. Attackers apply their re‑roll effects before defenders. |
| 4 | Identify any applicable SAIs that have not already been applied and apply their effects one by one* in whatever order you choose. Any normal action results or roll modifiers that those SAIs generate are applied during the following steps. |
| 5 | Count up all non‑SAI generated action results to obtain a subtotal. |
| 6 | Apply modifiers that subtract (results can never be reduced to below 0). |
| 7 | Apply modifiers that divide (results are rounded down). |
| 8 | Add SAI generated action results to obtain a new subtotal. |
| 9 | Apply modifiers that multiply. |
| 10 | Apply modifiers that add (any ‘counts as’ results are also added now) to obtain a final total. |

_* Multiples of the same SAI may be combined to create a single larger effect. See @31_special_action_icons.md for more details._

A die’s effect will resolve at its assigned time. If a die’s results are used and it then leaves the army, its results still stand. If a die leaves the army before its results are used, or a die enters the army after the roll, that die has no effect on that roll.

### ‘Counts As’ Results

A number of species abilities, and a few spells and SAIs, allow a unit to count one type of result they have rolled as another. For example, the species ability Coastal Dodge states: _‘When at a terrain that contains water, Coral Elves may count maneuver results as if they were save results.’_ Such an ability is called a ‘Counts As’ effect. Only rolled results may be counted in this way. Results
generated by spells may never be counted as another type of result. Any results that are counted as a different type of result are considered a modifier that adds, and as such are applied during step 10 of Die Roll Resolution.
