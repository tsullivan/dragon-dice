## Combination Rolls

Certain actions call for a ‘combination roll’. A combination roll involves making a single roll for an army, but counting multiple types of result. For example, following a dragon attack, an army makes a single combination roll counting any melee, missile and save results. Results are counted and applied as per the rules for resolving a dragon attack.

The following rules apply:

- During a combination roll, any modifiers to that roll which could be applied to different results are applied as the army’s owner desires. All modifiers must be applied if possible.
- If any ID icons are rolled, the owner of the army may choose what type of results they generate. IDs are assigned to a type of result when generated action results are subtotaled (see step 5).
- If an SAI generates a choice of different results (for example, Create Fireminions) then the player may split those results between those required by the roll.
- If an SAI generates different results for each type of roll counted by the combination roll, then the player who rolled that SAI may choose which result to apply. For example, if a unit is targeted by a Coil SAI they make a combination roll counting melee and saves. The targeted unit rolls a Counter SAI – in a melee roll this generates melee results, in a save roll this generates save results. That player may choose to count the SAI as applying to either the melee, or to the save part of the roll, but not to both.
