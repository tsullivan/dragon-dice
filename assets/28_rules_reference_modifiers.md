# Rules Reference

## Roll Modifiers

When a roll is made, it is not unusual for a number of game effects to modify that roll. To ensure the correct balance of the game, it is important to apply these modifiers in the correct order, as represented in the table in @27_rules_reference_die_roll_modifiers.md.

There are also a number of important rules that must be obeyed with regards to applying modifiers:

- Modifiers that affect an army do not affect the roll of an individual unit from that army.
- Modifiers that affect an individual unit do not affect the roll of an army.
- ID icons generate the type of result the roll is for. When results are subtracted or divided, ID results are the last results to be removed by those modifiers. If the roll is a combination roll the owner of the army may choose what result type the ID generates at the time action results are subtotaled (see step 5).
- There may never be more than one modifier that divides applied to each type of result.
- There may never be more than one modifier that multiplies applied to each type of result.

## Army Modifiers

Some effects have a stated duration (such as, “until the beginning of your next turn”). If an effect with duration targets an army, it applies to that army at a particular terrain or reserves. The effect ends if there are no units remaining in the army. This is checked at the end of each action. If all the units from the army are replaced with other units as a single action, the army is still considered to be present and so the effect remains active. Effects that apply to an army apply to all units in the army regardless when they joined the army.
