## Damage

When armies meet in combat - melee, missile, or magic - units may take damage. If a unit takes damage equal to or greater than its health it is killed and put in its owner’s DUA.

The following points should be observed when inflicting damage:

- If a unit takes less damage than its health, the damage goes away at the end of the action. The unit is considered healed.
- If possible, enough units must be killed to cover all remaining damage, but never in excess of it.
- Attacks or spells that target an army allow the entire army to make a save roll.
- Attacks, SAIs, and spells that target a unit only allow that unit to make a save roll. An individual unit that is targeted does not receive any benefits given to its army.
- Each point of save results generated, from icons, spells or any other source, negates one point of damage.

### Damage VS Killed

When a unit takes damage it is permitted to make a save roll unless an effect states otherwise. As stated above, if a unit takes damage equal to or greater than its health it is killed and put in its owner’s DUA.

If an effect states that a unit is killed then the unit is immediately put in its owner’s DUA, unless the effect provides an opportunity to roll a specific result to avoid it.

If some effect prevents a killed unit from entering the DUA (such as an Open Grave), any effects that take effect when the unit is killed, do not function. Any effect that prevents a unit from leaving a terrain, does not prevent it from being killed and placed into the DUA.

If a unit is under the effects of a spell or some other effect when it is killed, then all such spells and effects expire immediately.
