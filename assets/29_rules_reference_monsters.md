## Monsters

Monsters are worth four health each. The ID icon (marked with a triangle, circle or diamond for easy recognition) generates four of whatever results you are rolling for.

Unlike other units, normal action icons only ever appear singularly on the face of a monster. Any normal action icon rolled generates four results, so if a monster rolls a melee icon, that monster generates four melee results.
