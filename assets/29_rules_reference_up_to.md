## "Up to"

When an SAI targets a friendly army or unit, any number of health or units may be selected, less than or equal to the maximum allowed by the SAI, including none. For all other effects, when applying "up to" X amount of effect to a target, the maximum amount must be used but never in excess of that amount. If the exact X amount cannot be applied then as much as possible must be applied.
