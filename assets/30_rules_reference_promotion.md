## Promotion

Many effects in the game allow a player to promote a unit. To promote a unit, exchange it with a unit in your DUA (or Summoning Pool, if promoting Dragonkin) of the same species and one health larger. If a player has no units in their DUA (or Summoning Pool), then promotion cannot occur.

The following rules apply to promotion:

- A promotion affects only a single unit.
- If a rule indicates to promote or recruit as many units as possible, all promotions and recruitments happen at once. Identify all units that can be promoted, match each of them with a unit in the DUA (or Summoning Pool), then promote each of them simultaneously.
- Promoted Eldarim and Dragonkin are not required to be the same element.
- If the promotion affects an entire army, such as after killing a dragon, all units in the army, even those that did not roll, may be promoted.
- If an ability allows you to promote multiple health-worth at once you may choose to promote multiple units by one health each, or you may combine the health to promote to a larger unit, or any combination you choose.

### Notes on exchanging units with the DUA

In addition to Promotion, a number of other effects cause an army to exchange units with those in
a playerâ€™s DUA.

The following points must be observed:
- Multiple exchanges with the DUA happen all at once. Identify any units that need to be exchanged, then choose which units in the DUA they will be exchanged with before performing the exchange.
- Even if all the units in the army are exchanged, at no time is the entire army considered gone. As such all army-targeting spells remain in effect and all Dragonkin, minor terrains and items (providing enough units capable of carrying them are still present) remain in play. Only check to see if an army is still in place at the end of the exchange.
- If a unit is targeted by or subject to an individual effect (for example, is affected by the Hypnotic Glare SAI), exchanging the unit for another causes that effect to end.
- Units that are exchanged are never considered killed.
