# Special Action Icons

In addition to normal action and ID icons, certain units and items in Dragon Dice® also have Special Action Icons (SAIs). What differentiates SAIs from the other icons is that SAIs can have effects other than simply generating save, maneuver, melee, missile, or magic results.

Many SAIs generate a number of results based on the type of die or number of icons. To simplify this, SAIs use ‘X’ in their descriptions. Whenever X appears in the description of an SAI it refers to the number of results. This is how to determine the value of X:
- On a six-sided die, X is equal to the number of icons rolled (three icons equals three results).
- On a large equipment or large Dragonkin unit die side showing a single icon, X is equal to three results (one icon equals three results).
- On a monster, artifact, medallion, relic, or champion die side showing a single icon, X is equal to four results (one icon equals four results).

If an SAI does not have X in the description it only does what is described.
If a specific SAI description conflicts with the general rules for SAIs, the specific SAI description
takes precedence.

## Application

SAIs only apply during certain rolls. Each SAI in the table below states which rolls it applies to in the ‘Applies’ column. If a type of roll is not listed in the ‘Applies’ column description, that SAI has no effect in that type of roll.

The types are:
- Dragon Attack – When the army rolls in response to a dragon attack (see @17_dragons.md).
- Magic – Any time the army or unit is rolling for magic results.
- Maneuver – Any time the army or unit is rolling for maneuver results.
- Melee – Any time the army or unit is rolling for melee results.
- Missile – Any time the army or unit is rolling for missile results.
- Save – Any time the army or unit is rolling for save results against damage. Some SAIs only apply during save rolls against a specific type of damage and are noted as ‘Save*’ (for example, “save against melee”).
- Non-Maneuver – Any roll that does not include maneuver results.
- Individual – Any roll to avoid a spell or effect that targets a unit or X health worth of units.
- Special or marked with '*' – Check the SAI details for more information.

There are a number of rules which must be observed with relation to SAIs:
- Unless the word “may” appears in the SAI description, the effect is mandatory.
- In the DUA, the only SAIs that will function are SAIs that generate save results, unless the SAI specifically states otherwise.
- See ‘Combination Rolls’ in @28_rules_reference_combination_rolls.md for applying SAI results during a combination roll.

### Targeting

The following rules apply to the targeting of all SAIs:
- The same army or unit may not be targeted or affected by multiple SAI effects that multiply or divide the same type of result.
- SAIs that multiply or divide any army or unit's results (such as Elevate or Frost Breath), allow unit or items to move from the current army (such as Ferry or Firewalk), or target an individual unit (such as Coil or Hug), may not be combined and are always resolved one by one. All other SAIs may be combined by adding their effects together to count as one larger effect SAI. Alternatively, they may be resolved one by one.
- When an SAI targets an opponent’s army or units you must apply the SAI’s effect to the fullest extent
possible by selecting the maximum number of targets (units and/or health-worth) allowed.
- Any SAI that targets an individual unit will continue to affect that unit even if they move to another army.
