# Dragonkin

Dragonkin are the distant relatives of full-sized dragons. Like dragons, they can be summoned into play during a game, but unlike their less-predicable forerunners, Dragonkin will join your armies and fight for you! For every full three points of a player’s force size, that player may bring one healthworth of Dragonkin to the game. For example, in a 36 point game, a player may bring up to 12 health of Dragonkin units.

## Rules that apply to Dragonkin
- Dragonkin are six-sided units. While Dragonkin units consist of different elements, they are all considered one species.
- Like dragons, Dragonkin start the game in the Summoning Pool.
- Dragonkin cannot leave the terrain where they were summoned.
- If an army is made up solely of Dragonkin, the Dragonkin are immediately returned to the Summoning Pool and the army disappears.
- Dragonkin may never enter a player’s DUA. When a Dragonkin unit is killed it is returned to its owner’s Summoning Pool. Dragonkin may still be buried by a single effect that both kills and buries a unit, even though they do not pass into the DUA.
- Dragonkin cannot carry items.

## Actions  
- Dragonkin units cannot roll for magic or missile actions.
- Dragonkin units cannot roll during a dragon attack that includes a dragon matching their element, an Ivory Dragon, Ivory Hybrid Dragon, or White Dragon, but may take damage during the attack. Dragonkin may take part in dragon attacks with other dragons as normal. 

## Automatic Saves
All Dragonkin have armored skin, which grants them automatic save results equal to their health. These save results are added to their individual and army’s save rolls. For the purpose of ‘Die Roll Resolution’, Dragonkin automatic saves are added during step 10, along with other modifiers that add. Their automatic save results are only applied if the Dragonkin are rolled.
