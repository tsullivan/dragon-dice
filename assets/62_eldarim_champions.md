# Eldarim Champion

Eldarim Champions are the heroes of the Eldarim Species. They are represented in the game by very large six-sided dice. Each Eldarim Champion has four health, the same as a monster (Eldarim have champions instead of monsters).

## Types of Eldarim Champions

There are six different types of Eldarim Champion, though only three different ID icons are used. Each type of champion has access to a different special ability.

All Eldarim Champions are part of the Eldarim species.

- Dragonlord / Dragonmaster
- Dragonslayer / Dragonhunter
- Dragoncrusader / Dragonzealot

Dragonlords, Dragonslayers and Dragoncrusaders are all white and therefore contain all elements.

Dragonmasters, Dragonhunters and Dragonzealots come in all of the five elements. 

## Eldarim Champion SAI

Eldarim Champions have an SAI with the following rules:

| Champion | Applies | Effect
|-|-|-
| All Eldarim Champions | •Individual | During a save roll against an individual-targeting effect, the SFR/TSR logo generates four save results.
| Dragonlord (Tame a Dragon) | •Dragon Attack | **A Dragonlord may tame ANY type of dragon.** <br><br>During the dragon attack phase, when rolling an army’s response to a dragon attack (step 6), a unit that rolls this SAI may tame a single dragon that attacked their army this turn. Any non-breath damage that dragon rolled during this dragon attack is ignored. <br><br>On future turns, a tamed dragon will not attack an army containing the unit that tamed it. Tamed dragons still attack other dragons as normal. During the Retreat Step of the Reserves Phase, the taming unit may ride the dragon, moving itself and the tamed dragon to any other terrain. The dragon remains tamed when they move in this way. <br><br>A White Dragon becomes untamed during the Effects Expire step of the taming player’s turn. Any other dragon remains tamed by this unit unless any of the following occur: <br><br>- If the taming unit tames another dragon. A unit may only ever tame one dragon at a time. <br>- The dragon leaves the terrain without the taming unit (e.g. is summoned away or killed). <br>- The taming unit leaves the terrain without the dragon (e.g. moves or is killed). - The dragon is tamed or controlled by another unit.
| Dragonmaster (Tame a Dragon) | •Dragon Attack <br>•Any | **A Dragonmaster may tame any dragon that contains its element.** <br><br>See entry for ‘Dragonlord’ above. <br><br>In addition, during any other roll, this SAI is considered to be an ID icon which generates two results.
| Dragonslayer (Slay a Dragon) | •Dragon Attack | **A Dragonslayer may slay ANY dragon.** <br><br>During the dragon attack phase, when rolling an army’s response to a dragon attack (step 6), a unit that rolls this SAI may slay a single dragon that attacked their army this turn. Any non-breath damage that dragon rolled during this dragon attack is ignored. <br><br>A slain dragon is not returned to its owner’s Summoning Pool, but is instead removed from the game entirely. If a White Dragon is slain, roll the dragon. If it rolls a jaws result, the slaying unit is buried. No units are promoted when a dragon is slain.
| Dragonhunter (Slay a Dragon) | •Dragon Attack •Any | **A Dragonhunter may slay any dragon that contains its element.** <br><br>See entry for ‘Dragonslayer’ above. <br><br>In addition, during any other roll, this SAI is considered to be an ID icon which generates two results.

Any non-breath damage that dragon rolled during this dragon attack is ignored. <br><br>On future turns, during the dragon attack phase, the controller may have the controlled dragon not roll, or may have it attack any other dragon, even a type of dragon that it would not usually attack. If another dragon attacks the controller’s army, roll the controlled dragon and add any damage it inflicts to the melee results of the army, ignoring any Wings results. The dragon is not considered to be a part of the army and may not take damage when a dragon attacks the controller’s army in this way. <br><br>A White Dragon becomes uncontrolled during the Effects Expire step of the controlling player’s turn. Any other dragon remains controlled by this unit unless any of the following occur: <br><br>- The controlling unit controls another dragon.
