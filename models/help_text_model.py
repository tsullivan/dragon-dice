<b>Welcome to the Dragon Dice Companion!</b>
<p>Dragon Dice is a game of fantasy battles where players assemble armies of dice representing different fantasy races and creatures.
Each die has unique icons for movement, melee, missiles, magic, and special abilities.
Players maneuver their armies across terrain dice, engage in combat, and attempt to capture two terrains to win the game.
