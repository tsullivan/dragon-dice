The dragon is not considered to be a part of the army and may not take damage when a dragon attacks the controller's army in this way.

A Dragonzealot may only ever control one dragon at any time. *	The dragon leaves the terrain (eg. is summoned away or killed). *	The controlling unit leaves the terrain (eg. moves or is killed). *	The dragon is controlled or tamed by another unit. *	A White Dragon becomes uncontrolled during the Effects Expire step of the controlling player's turn.
